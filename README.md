# Aim Trainer

## Description
Aim Trainer spawns targets randomly around the for the player to click on. The more targets you click, the higher your score. Accuracy is tracked, so randomly clicking will hurt both your accuracy and score. There are three difficulties to choose from, which determine the number of targets spawned at once and the size of the targets. Once the program is initialized, the player can continue to replay the game without needing to rerun the program. The player can exit the program at any time using ESCAPE or QUIT. Another fun feature is the user ability to select their own target image. The user will be prompted to choose a file after choosing the difficulty.

# Aim Trainer Plus

## Overview

Countless missed shots on fortnite, hundreds of losses on call of duty, all of this led us to wonder: How could we get better at shooting games? While there are many aim trainers that exist today we found that a lot of them lack personality, which led us to discover and implement the import feature of out game, shown below. 

The player will be able to import an image that is the target that they want to shoot. This allows the player to have more fun with the game, and potentially more motivation to hit their target. 

Another key feature of ours is the user's ability to choose difficulty. We have three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium and Hard. The higher level that is chosen will result in more targets popping out as well as a longer play time.

# Aim Trainer Plus

## Overview

Countless missed shots on fortnite, hundreds of losses on call of duty, all of this led us to wonder: How could we get better at shooting games? While there are many aim trainers that exist today we found that a lot of them lack personality, which led us to discover and implement the import feature of out game, shown below. 

The player will be able to import an image that is the target that they want to shoot. This allows the player to have more fun with the game, and potentially more motivation to hit their target. 

Another key feature of ours is the user's ability to choose difficulty. We have three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium and Hard.

The higher level that is chosen will result in smaller targets. Those who are up for the challenge can choose hard mode which has targets that are only .25 inch in diamater. The different target sizes are displayed below from easy to hard:

Once you are finished with the game you will be able to see the score that you acheived (how many targets you hit) and your accuracy (how many of your clicks were on target). Try and beat your friends scores and improve accuracy to become a better player at shooting games!
